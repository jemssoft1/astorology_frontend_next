  what_is_sadhesati: "Sadhe Sati refers to the seven-and-a-half year period in which Saturn moves through three signs, the moon sign, one before the moon and the one after it. Sadhe Sati starts when Saturn (Shani) enters the 12th sign from the birth Moon sign and ends when Saturn leaves 2nd sign from the birth Moon sign. Since Saturn approximately takes around two and half years to transit a sign which is called Shani's dhaiya it takes around seven and half year to transit three signs and that is why it is known as Sadhe Sati. Generally Sade-Sati comes thrice in a horoscope in the life time - first in childhood, second in youth & third in old-age. First Sade-Sati has effect on education & parents. Second Sade-Sati has effect on profession, finance & family. The last one affects health more than anything else."
