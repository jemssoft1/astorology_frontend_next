Sadhe Sati starts when Saturn (Shani) enters the 12th sign from the birth Moon sign and ends when Saturn leaves 2nd sign from the birth Moon sign.  Since Saturn approximately takes around two and half years to transit a sign which is called Shani's dhaiya  it takes around seven and half year to transit three signs  and that is why it is known as Sadhe Sati. Generally Sade-Sati comes thrice in a horoscope in the life time - first in childhood, second in youth & third in old-age. First Sade-Sati has effect on education & parents. Second Sade-Sati has effect on profession, finance & family. The last one affects health more than anything else."

    "report": "Your Ascendant (also known as your Rising sign) is the first impression others have of you, before getting to know the 'real' you. Becoming acquainted with one’s Rising Sign (which is only possible if your exact time of birth is known), can help you figure out what your soul is drawn to, and it also reveals ways you may feel 'seen' by others, and by the world. With your Ascendant in Aquarius, you’re often perceived as quirky, independent, and a little unpredictable. You march to the beat of your own drum, and honestly, you’d prefer if everyone else just let you do your thing. You bring fresh perspectives wherever you go, often challenging norms and sparking new ideas. But the shadow side of this placement can involve detachment or feeling like an outsider. You may struggle to fully connect with others, preferring ideas and ideals over raw emotions. Your journey involves finding the balance between independence and intimacy—allowing yourself to be both free-spirited and deeply connected."
